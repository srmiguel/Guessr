This is my take on the popular 'Wordle' game (in Spanish) using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

Features:

- Interactive on-screen Keyboard synced to physical keyboard.
- Default dark mode, switch to toggle light mode.
- Game instructions modal on load, accessible at all times.
- Smooth CSS animations and clear feedback to improve UX.
- Word pool of +10.000 words
